In this work we address the problem of findfing behaviors violating a
given time bounded LTL property in hybrid dynamical systems. We
approach the problem in two distinct steps. First, we approximate the
behavior of the underlying system using a piecewise discrete-time
affine model. This model incomplete in nature and is computed with
respect to the given property.  We then encode the falsification
search as a bounded model checking query and use an SMT solver to find
a counter example. If found, we check if violation is also satisfied
by the given numerical simulation engine. If it is not, we refine our
models and repeat.
